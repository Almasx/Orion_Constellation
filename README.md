# Orion_Constellation
In this project, I have played the part of an astrophysicist who has the job of visualizing constellation data for the Hayden Planetarium in NYC. I have used Matplotlib to programmatically visualize both 2D and 3D charts, including a 3D scatter plot that maps the x, y, and z coordinates of the Orion constellation.
